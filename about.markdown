Hey, I'm Abdurraafay. I'm a Software Engineer who previously worked at Shopify. I've spent the last decade building and shipping software for Apple platforms -- iOS, macOS, and now visionOS.

These days I spend most of my time building things with Claude and writing about what I learn along the way. I like to muse about things I find interesting while building software, hiking, or on long drives.

I'm always looking for interesting projects to work on. Let's connect.
